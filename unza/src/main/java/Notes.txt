Data Migration
-------------------
The Migration of data from SRS into opus has been split into three parts: Extraction, loading
and Transformation. 
PHASE I
-----------
During the Extraction phase the tool moves the data from the source system (Informix)
into a temporary schema on the postgresql server called srsdatastage. A number of data cleansing
 transformations are applied to the data to keep it concise and consistent. 

PHASE II
---------
During the loading phase the data is then moves from the staging area into the live opuscollege
database schema. During this stage a number of transformations are applied to the data being loaded 
to make it compliant to the conventions adopted in opuscollege.

PHASE III
----------
The transformation phase spans both the extraction and loading phases of the migration

CURRICULUM DATA
---------------
The curriculum data migration has a number of challenges. Of these the most outstanding is that 
there is direct relationship between a course and the Major. This is because a course belongs to
a school as opposed to belonging to a Study as the case in opuscollege. A work around this problem
has been developed using the already existing data in the source system to establish a relationship 
between a course and a major (study).

PROBLEM DEFINITIONS:
1.It is possible to relate a course (subject) to a school but not directly possible to relate it 
to study.
2. At creation, a course requires a primary study to be defined before the course is created
3. The primary study needs to be related to an organizational unit

SOLUTION:
1.Create a primary study for each school to be used as a place holder for each course that belongs to
that school. i.e for NS create NSPrimaryStudy. Then relate all courses belonging to school of NS 
to the study NSPrimaryStudy, for HSS create HSSPrimaryStudy.
2.Do this for all the schools
3.migrate the courses
	--load the course record
	--extract the schcode
	--use the schoolcode to identify which PrimaryStudy to attach the course to. i.e by
	possible traversing a map of deafultPrimaryStudies for each school.
4.Migrate the Majors as Studies. Create a version for part-time a version for full-time. In short, 
create a version for each of the available categories of study.

5.Create a subjectstudygradetype ***for each of the categories of study*** i.e. one for full-time, 
one for part-time,one for distance.
	--use the srsdatastage.credit table, srsdatastage.quota table and the srsdatastage.acadyr 
	table to relate the course
	to a major.
	--try to check for duplicates in this process. i.e. if a course has already been tied to a 
	major and quota this should not be duplicated for another student taking the same combination 
	of course, major and quota.

STUDENT DATA
-----------------
The student data will be migrated as follows:
	1.migrate basic student information as contained in the srsdatastage.student table
	2.migrate student academic details by creating a studyplan for each student record
		-load a student from srsdatastage student table
			-use this student's id to load the student object from opuscollege schema
				-verify that the object is not null
			-use this opuscollege student object to create a studyplan for the student
			-Use the srsdatastage.acadyr table to determine the student's Primary Study (mjrcode)
			-Use the srsdatastage.acadyr table to determine the StudyGradeType for the student (qtacode)
			-Use the srsdatastage.credit table to build the studyplancardinaltimeunitresult 
			(end of semester comment from obtained from srsdatastage.acadyr comment column) and
			the result for each individual subject.
			
	   -Nationality
	   		-pick a record from the nation table in the stage schema
	   		-Find a match in the country table
	   			-search the List returned of opus countries using the nationality field from 
	   			the nation table as a Key.
	   			-when a match is found create a Map(nation.code,country.code)
