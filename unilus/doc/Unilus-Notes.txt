  For now using the CBU version (including courses from all senior years)

- In which format are grades/marks usually written?
  unza style: mark (grade)          example: 88 (A)

- Student number format?
  currently: YYNNNNN

- Ranges for grades, e.g. from 80-90: A; 90-100: A+
  (to make database script)
