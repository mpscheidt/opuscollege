architecture (CBA)</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Objective:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Allow development of plugins (=modules)
for opusCollege which are independent of the opusCollege core.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Benefits for management:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each university can install the
particular plugins that they want, and is not obliged to install
other plugins.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Each university can develop its own
plugins.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Benefits for system development
(according to Nora Mulira):</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">- Reduce development and maintenance
costs</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">- Increase productivity</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">- Increased scalability</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Issues:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Prepare the kernel to handle
	plugins</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Versioning of plugins (and the
	kernel itself)</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Updating from one version to the
	next, particularly DB changes</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">adding and removing plugins at
	least at server startup or, ideally, at any time</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">dependencies between bundles 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">classloader issues 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">exporting services to and
	importing services from other bundles 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">sharing of resources between
	plugins (like HTTP sessions) 
	</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">using plugin architecture together
	with servlet container (which one controls the other?)</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The dynamic nature of a plugin
architecture becomes apparent when plugins are installed and
uninstalled during runtime of opusCollege. This is especially with
class loading: Typically in Java, there is a classpath defined when a
Java Virtual Machine (VM) is started and the classpath is rather not
dynamic. With dynamic plugins the classpath changes and this is a
challenge not only for classes written for  opusCollege plugins but
also for classes from 3<SUP>rd</SUP> party libraries.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Alternatives:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">a) build tools like 'ant' or
	'maven' 
	</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">b) develop own plug-in framework which
	deploys WAR and JAR files within Tomcat</P>
	<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">c) use a framework that enables
	plug-in architecture and is already available, like OSGi</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ad a) Build tools like 'ant' or 'maven'</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When build tools only are used to
achieve a certain level of component based architecture, then it is
necessary to create the application archive every time additional
modules shall be added or updated to a new version. This can be an
easy solution to have at least a limited level of modularization. No
issues arise concerning sharing of resources or classloaders. On the
other hand, the separation between modules is not as clear as with
other solutions: It is difficult to protect modules from being
accessed by other modules. Additionally, it is necessary to deal with
build tool configurations on the command line in order to build the
stack of wanted modules into one single WAR file.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ad b) develop own plug-in framework
which deploys WAR and JAR files within Tomcat</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This option would enable a framework
where plugins can be managed from within the OpusCollege web
application. One of the great challenges would be to handle sharing
of resources and classloader issues. In a web application which is
deployed in a WAR file, a HTTP session is present. If plugins are
deployed outside the WAR file in separate JARs or WARs, it is not
easily possible to use the same HTTP session since they are not part
of the same WAR file, and hence a separate session would be created.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This option requires considerable
implementation effort.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">ad c) use a framework that enables
plug-in architecture and is already available, like OSGi</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If an existing framework can be reused
it obviously has to potential to prevent reinventing the wheel.
However, frameworks in this area are rare or not mature yet. Examples
include the <SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">“Java Plugin
Framework” or OSGi. Some of these framework are not applicable to
web applications.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">OSGi
is a much broader technology and is designed to handle many issues
like</SPAN></P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">portability
	of applications</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">complexity
	of big software systems: here the plugin-architecture comes in,
	together with configuration issues and service oriented architecture</SPAN></P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">life
	cycle of software modules</SPAN></P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><SPAN STYLE="background: transparent">The
OSGi specification is already implemented independently several times
by e. g. Apache and Eclipse. There have been developed solutions for
web based systems, including servlet container based systems like
Tomcat. It is difficult to estimate, though, how big the
implementation effort will be.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Not all 3<SUP>rd</SUP> party libraries
are capable of being run within the dynamic OSGi environment.
Hibernate still seems incapable to be run in OSGi whereas iBatis can
be used already.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Spring Dynamic Modules (Spring DM)
version 1.0 has been released recently and it is a good sign to have
a stable and tested version for integration of OSGi into Spring.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Equinox (by Eclipse) has developed
libraries for deploying OSGi on the server side – both deploying
Equinox as a OSGi container within a servlet container and deploying
a servlet container (Jetty, not Tomcat) as OSGi bundles.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">There are several issues on the way to
have a web application powered by plugins:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Use Spring DM</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Use Equinox</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Use Jetty instead of Tomcat</P>
</UL>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">As there is no dependency on Tomcat the
switch to Jetty should be possible – both conform to the servlet
specifications.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The recommended setup is Equinox being
the base container deploying the servlet container as a bundle within
Equinox (although it seems only a configuration issue to switch the
setup). To get Spring DM into play, each bundle including the servlet
container bundle would need to be able to have its own Spring
application context. Spring DM promises to have a “highly
non-intrusive nature” to take care of this aspect.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">A difficulty might remain the
integration of 3<SUP>rd</SUP> party libraries not yet prepared for
OSGi. But there seem to be several ways around for most of the
libraries, as described in the FAQ of Spring DM. Furthermore, the
next release (version 1.1) will mainly take care about this issue, so
help seems underway.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The change in the opusCollege
application would be profound with some hurdles underway, at the same
time possibly opening the door to an application that can be managed
more easily from the perspectives of system administrators,
developers and project coordinators, and with its SOA like
architecture would make system integration with other applications in
the university easier.</P>
