Observations of integrating jasper reports into the core of opusCollege
by Markus Pscheidt

Additional files:
=================

- src/org.uci.opus.college.web.flow.ReportController.java: executes jasper reports

- web/WEB-INF/lib/jasperreports-1.3.1.jar
- web/WEB-INF/lib/poi-2.5.1.jar: needed for creating Excel reports
- web/WEB-INF/lib/commons-beanutils.jar: needed by jasper reports

- web/WEB-INF/reports/basic_report_opuscollege.jasper: the demo report called in start.jsp


Modified files:
===============

- web/WEB-INF/jsp/start.jsp: added a demo on how to execute the "basic_report"

- web/WEB-INF/applicationContext-flox.xml: defined the bean "reportsController"
- web/WEB-INF/frontcontroller-servlet.xml: map /reports.view to the reportsController

Notes:
======

- Thanks to Karol for the initial code implementation.

- The basic report gives a report of all female students.
  So there need to be female students defined to have results.

- This is a basic implementation for a report without parameters.
  Adding parameters needs some adjustment in the ReportController.java.

- The Html report has still a problem with using images.
  It has something to do with the location of images.
  
- To execute other reports:
  - add the compiled .jasper file to the reports folder
  - add a link like the the one in start.jsp to execute the report.

- If we want reports to be checked into the opusCollegeReports CVS project,
  we would need to copy the reports in the build process to the reports dir within the war file.
  (e. g. with ant).
