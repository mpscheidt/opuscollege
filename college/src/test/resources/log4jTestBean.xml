    <!-- Configure logging at running tests.

         If logging would not be configured, the following problem would occur:
         When running tests via from e.g. opus\applications\default_all
         then the system searches in <current-dir>/src/test/java/log4j.properties
         e.g. C:\opus_workspace\opus\applications\default_all\src\test\java\log4j.properties (or log4j2 equivalent)
         which is wrong (file does not exist).
